## DONE

index.css
index.tsx

## MORE TO DO

sharedTypes
start again at DermatologySubcategoryName

app.tsx working through the actions object
also need to have (this.refToMeasureInDetailBoardHeaderContainingDiv.getBoundingClientRect() as DOMRect).top > 0
and more detailed examples of how I've used refs together with event listeners

data folder
DID for more to cover:
eg comparison: getComparisonOptions(newlySelectedDuration)[0]
eg how this data get used

## ?

Why do I need to do this in a switch statement
```
default:
const _exhaustiveCheck: never = selectedDuration
return _exhaustiveCheck           
```
